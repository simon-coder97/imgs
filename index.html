<article id="tribute" class="text-content">
<p><em>Jackson's work from the 1970s to the early 1990s showed "immense originality, adaptability, and ambition" that "generate genius beats, hooks, arrangements, and vocals (though not lyrics)"; music that "will stand forever as a reproach to the puritanical notion that pop music is slick or shallow and that's the end of it.</em></p>
